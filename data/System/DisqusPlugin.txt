%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

%TOPIC% allows to embed the popular [[http://disqus.com/][DISQUS]] commenting system to Foswiki. This is mostly
of use when running a public site on the internet to allow a more wider range of people to comment on your site.
Instead of requiring them to register and log in to your site, they can use their existing Disqus, Facebook, google+
or twitter identity already authenticated on the net.

Note that all comments will be stored on disqus.com, not on your own server. There are however APIs to import and
export this data. Further note that you will have to register an account on disqus.com and register your Foswiki
site. The generated short name for your site then has to be stored in ={DisqusPlugin}{ForumName}=. 
All maintenance of comments including moderation is done via disqus.com as well, not on your own site.

Use =%!DISQUS%= on any page to start a discussion on that page. 

Use =%!DISQUS_COUNT%= to display the number of comments on page.
